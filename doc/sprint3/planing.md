previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
building A.

* **T.3.2** - Update the buildingB.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
building B.  Final integration of each memberâ€™s Packet Tracer simulation into a
single simulation.

* **T.3.3** - Update the buildingC.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
building C.

* **T.3.4** - Update the buildingD.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the
previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for
building D.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

The following were the design decisions made for the project, and are to be followed by all members of the project:

* **OSPF area ids**
    * Area 0 - Campus backbone
    * Area 1 - Building A
    * Area 2 - Building B
    * Area 3 - Building C
    * Area 4 - Building D

  
* **VoIP phone numbers and prefix digits**
  * Building A - 1
  * Building B - 2
  * Building C - 3
  * Building D - 4 (numbers 4000 and 4001)


* **DNS domain names**
    * Building A - rcomp-22-23-db-g5
    * Building B - building-B.rcomp-22-23-db-g5
    * Building C - building-C.rcomp-22-23-db-g5
    * Building D - building-D.rcomp-22-23-db-g5


* **IPv4 node address of the DNS name server of each DNS domain**
  * Building A - 
  * Building B - 10.80.116.242
  * Building C - 
  * Building D - 10.80.118.242
